# Synthetic Home

This is Home Assistant custom component that generates a synthetic home from a
configuration file, used for testing.

## Synthetic Home Configuration

See `custom_components/synthetic_home/home_model/synthetic_home.py` for a description of the configuration
file format. This is essentially modeled after Home Assistants `demo` platform
but allows you to name devices and stick them in areas using a configuration file.

## Synthetic Home Generation

Given an example synthetic home configuration file `farmhouse.yaml`:

```yaml
---
name: Family Farmhouse
devices:
  Family Room:
    - name: Family Room Lamp
      device_type: light
      device_info:
        manufacturer: Phillips
        model: Hue
    - name: Family Room
      device_type: hvac
      device_info:
        manufacturer: Nest
        sw_version: 1.0.0
      attributes:
        unit_of_measurement: Â°F
        current_temperature: 60
    - name: Left Window
      device_type: window-sensor
    - name: Right Window
      device_type: window-sensor
  Entry:
    - name: Front Door
      device_type: smart-lock
  Kitchen:
    - name: Light
      device_type: light-dimmable
    - name: Coffe Maker
      device_type: smart-plug
      device_info:
        manufacturer: Shelly
  Master Bedroom:
    - name: Bedroom Light
      device_type: light-dimmable
    - name: Bedroom Blinds
      device_type: smart-blinds
      device_info:
        model: RollerBlinds
        manufacturer: Motion Blinds
        sw_version: 1.1.0
    - name: Bedroom Window
      device_type: window-sensor
  Garage:
    - name: Garage Door
      device_type: garage-door
  Front Yard:
    - name: Front motion
      device_type: motion-sensor
```

You can generate a Home Assistant `config/` directory that is setup with the
synthetic home integration:

```bash
$ export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:${PWD}/custom_components"
$ python3 -m script.storage --config farmhouse.yaml --output_dir=config/
```

This creates the `config/` directory and you can then start up home assistant:

```bash
$ hass -c config/
```

And it will create all the synthetic devices for you:

## Manual Creation

You can also add Synthetic Home like a normal integration. During the configuration
flow you specify a yaml file like `farmhouse.yaml` and it expects to find it in your
`config/` folder next to `configuration.yaml`. (This is similar above, and the same
step the storage generation tool is doing internally).

## Testing

See `tests/` for examples of how to create a synthetic devices in your tests
using `pytest-homeassistant-custom-component`.

## Device Registry

The device types are defined in `custom_components/synthetic_home/device_types/`
where each device type is defined in a separate file. See the [README](custom_components/synthetic_home/device_types/README.md) for more details.

You can interact with the device registry using the device registry tooling:

```bash
$ export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:${PWD}/custom_components"
$ python3 -m script.device_registry --command=dump
```

This will output the available device types for use in other data generation tools:
```
---
- desc: A device attached to a door that can detect if it is opened or closed.
  device_type: door-sensor
- desc: A a garage door that can be controlled remotely.
  device_type: garage-door
- desc: An movable barrier that can be monitored and opened and closed remotely.
  device_type: gate
- desc: A climate devie that only supports heating.
  supported_attributes:
  - unit_of_measurement
  - current_temperature
  device_type: heat-pump
...
```
