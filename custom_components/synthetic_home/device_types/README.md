# Device Type Registry

A device type is a definition of a type of physical device in a smart home. A
device may additionally be represented by multiple entities. For example, a
climate-hvac device may be represented by a climage entity and a temperature
sensor entity.

Device types are defined to represent common configured household devices,
but may not support every single feature in the smart home. That is, these
are meant to be representative, but not necessarily exhaustive.

Each file in this directory contains a device type name. New device types
may be added as new use cases are needed.
