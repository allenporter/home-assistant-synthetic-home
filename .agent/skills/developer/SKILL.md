# Project Development Skill

This skill teaches you how to interact with the Supernote-Lite codebase using standardized scripts, following the "Scripts to Rule Them All" pattern.

## Core Scripts

| Script             | When to use                                                                    |
| :----------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `script/bootstrap` | After cloning or when dependencies change.                                     |
| `script/setup`     | Before starting to setup the virtual environment.                              |
| `script/test`      | Before submitting changes or to verify functionality.                          |
| `script/lint`      | Before committing to ensure code style and quality.                            |
| `script/update`    | When looking to sync down changes from the upstream repo.                      |
| `script/server`    | When you need a running server for integration testing or manual verification. |

## Usage Patterns

### Standard Development Flow

1. **Initialize**: `./script/bootstrap`
2. **Pre-requistes**: `./script/setup` to start development
3. **Implement**: Make your changes to the code.
4. **Lint**: `./script/lint` to check for style issues.
5. **Test**: `./script/test` to run the test suite.
6. **Verify**: `./script/server` to run an ephemeral server for manual checks.

### Notes

- All scripts are located in the `script/` directory at the project root.
- Scripts are designed to be run from the project root.
- The scripts will automatically use `uv` if it is installed, otherwise they will fall back to standard Python tools.
